We may reach out to you. We might want to alert you to research events, like webinars. We might want to tell you about other research opportunities.<br/><br/>

You can still participate in SAMPLE even if you opt out of these follow up notifications.<br/><br/>

There are two ways to opt out of follow up notifications. You can adjust the &quot;permissions&quot; setting in your SAMPLE profile. Or you can <import href="consent_contact.html"/>.
