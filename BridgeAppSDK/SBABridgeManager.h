 The `SBABridgeManager` is a wrapper for accessing BridgeSDK methods. The intention is to consolidate all the methods
 used by this SDK in a single manager in order to facilitate using this SDK as an example for how to use BridgeSDK
 managers directly in your own app, as well as to simplify the access because this SDK is written primarily in Swift
 whereas the access to BridgeSDK is simpier to read if written in objective-c. 
 
 @note syoung 10/05/2017 There are a few instances where `SBBUploadManager` is accessed directly and not through this
 wrapper.

 Fetch the StudyParticipant record from cache if caching is turned on, otherwise from the Bridge API.
 
 Note that if BridgeSDK was initialized with caching, the StudyParticipant record will always exist in the cache
 once the client has signed in for the first time, and since StudyParticipant is client-updatable, the cached copy
 would take priority over whatever Bridge responded with, so with caching turned on, this method will never try to
 retrieve the StudyParticipant from Bridge.
 
 Note also that the UserSessionInfo object received from Bridge on signIn is a superset of StudyParticipant, and
 upon successful signIn, any existing StudyParticipant object is deleted from cache and re-created from the
 UserSessionInfo. If any changes are made to the StudyParticipant on the Bridge server that didn't come from this
 client, the client's sessionToken should be invalidated, forcing the client to sign back in and thus update its
 cached StudyParticipant from the server.

 @note If using caching, be aware that calling this method (or any of the convenience methods which call it) will remove unexpired, unfinished scheduled activities from the cache. The next call to get scheduled activities will replace them with the correct schedule going forward for the new set of data groups. If you're not using the SDK's built-in caching, you will need to take

 Gets all available, started, or scheduled activities for a user. The "daysAhead" parameter allows you to retrieve activities that are scheduled in the future for the indicated number of days past today. This allows certain kinds of UIs (e.g. "You have N activities tomorrow" or "You have completed N of X activities today", even when the activities are not yet to be performed). A "daysBehind" parameter allows you to retain previously-cached activities that have not yet been completed that expired within the indicated number of days in the past. This allows UIs that say, e.g., "You left N activities uncompleted yesterday." Scheduled activities will be returned in the timezone of the device at the time of the request. Once a task is finished, or expires (the time has passed for it to be started), or becomes invalid due to a schedule change on the server, it will be removed from the list of scheduled activities returned from Bridge, and (except for previously-fetched but unfinished tasks within daysBehind) will also be removed from the list passed to this method's completion handler.
 

@note Both `daysAhead` and `daysBehind` are limited by the caching that is initially set up and by the server. For the case where the number of days ahead being requested is greater than 4, this value will return a limit of 4 schedules. For example, if an activity is scheduled 4 times per day over the week, then only 4 days ahead will be returned by the server. If the activity is scheduled once per month, then the next 4 schedules (4 months) will be returned.

@param daysAhead   A number of days in the future for which to retrieve available/started/scheduled activities.
